## Designs

### Interview questions

1. How often do you cook per week?

2. How often do you buy grocery a week? How do you determine what to buy in a grocery trip? How much money do you spend on grocery a week?

3. How often do you search for new recipe? Where do you find new recipes? Do you face any difficulities finding new recipes?

4. How do you make sure you are following the recipe while cooking? How strictly do you follow the recipe?

7. If there is a smart cookbook device, what features would you like to see?

### Interview answers

<DetailsSummary summary="Aniruddhan - 2nd year">

1. Cook 3 times a week, mostly breakfast and lunch. Other meals eat out or eat at university dining hall (due to not having enough time to cook)

2. Once a week grocery → buy common items that is running out

3. Only look new recipes often once a month → Keep coming back to familiar recipes.

Find new recipes through Google; mostly consume text-based recipes. Reportedly feeling too cumbersome to find new recipes: New techniques, new ingredients, new taste makes it time consuming

4. Follow recipe by: Only look at entire recipe once before starting to understand it

→ Come back when forget, do not hold phone all the time
→ Reported difficulities: sometimes make mistake that makes final dish unsatisfactory due to mis-doing a recipe step

5. Recipe criteria: Simplicity, how much time consumes, familiary and preferred taste (Indian and spicy), dish attractiveness

6. Disaster story: Not realize that didn't have enough ingredient before cooking

Success story: Replacing an ingredients in the recipe with an alternative ingredient available at home

7. Desired features:

7. Desired smart cookbook features:
    - AI that understands personal preferences and tastes

### User needs analysis

Across the 4 different interviewee, there are some similaries and some differences. The following are the analysis and conclusions I drew:
- There are two main ways users shop for grocery and determine what recipes to cook next:
    1. Determine what recipes to cook first, and then buy required ingredients
    2. Buy ingredients first (usually aim for discount price) and then think about what recipes fit those ingredients
- All participants high favor simplicity and conserving time and see them as a deal breaker when choosing between recipes. After that, emphasis is placed on visual attractiveness and perceived taste of the dish.

    --> **Conclusion**: User needs a way to quickly glance the different attributes of a recipe: simplicity, time commitment, ease of obtaining ingredients, visual attractiveness, etc.
- About using recipe, some try to remember the recipe all at once but reportedly have problems mis-remembering a crucial step; some try to look at the recipe through their phone once in a while, but reported not having enough hands.

    --> **Conclusion**: Users would love to be able to remember the recipe or use the recipe hands-free when cooking.

- Desired features can be grouped into 4 main types:
    1. Suggestion of new recipe; could be based on internal factors (user inventory and cooking skills) and/or external factors (other user's rating)
    2. Intuitive display of recipe that is easy to follow and remember
    3. Suggestion alternative versions of same recipes
    4. Cooking help and support: Know if the product of each step is satisfactory

### Assumption
- When used, the smart cookbook device is within 6ft distance with the user
- The smart cookbook device has an AI (or connects to an external AI) that userstands user voice commands (like Alexa or Google Home)
- The smart cookbook device can come with a mobile phone application to control the device's preferences (though the device itself might still contain some buttons for basic settings)

### Design requirements

From analysis of user interviews and user needs, I decided the design requirements for the Smart Cookbook device:
1. User should be able to find their recipes based on their needs. These can include equipment, time or ingredient constraints.
2. User should be able to gauge the visual attrativeness and taste of the recipe
3. Once decided on a recipe, user should to be able to follow the recipe while cooking without using their limbs
4. User should be able to clearly understand the directions in the recipes.
5. User should be able to see opinions of similar demographics on the recipe

### Design challenges and 10-plus-10 sketches

I chose the following 3 design challenges:
1. How to allow user to follow a recipe with minimal interaction with the device
2. How to quickly show the simplicity of a reciple (and compare against other recipes) when a user searches for new recipes
3. How to allow users to assess the opinions of other people on a recipe

## Basic UI

### C-level prototype sketches
