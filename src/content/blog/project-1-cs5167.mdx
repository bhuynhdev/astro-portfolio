## Designs

### Interview questions

1. How often do you cook per week?

2. How often do you buy grocery a week? How do you determine what to buy in a grocery trip? How much money do you spend on grocery a week?

3. How often do you search for new recipe? Where do you find new recipes? Do you face any difficulities finding new recipes?

4. How do you make sure you are following the recipe while cooking? How strictly do you follow the recipe?

5. While looking at new recipes to choose, what criteria do you look for (in other words, what makes you choose a recipe over other)? Rank these criteria by importance?

6. Tell a success or a disaster story you had on your cooking history?

7. If there is a smart cookbook device, what features would you like to see?

### Interview answers

<DetailsSummary summary="Aniruddhan - 2nd year">

1. Cook 3 times a week, mostly breakfast and lunch. Other meals eat out or eat at university dining hall (due to not having enough time to cook)

2. Once a week grocery → buy common items that is running out

3. Only look new recipes once a month → Keep coming back to familiar recipes.

Find new recipes through Google; mostly consume text-based recipes. Reportedly feeling too cumbersome to find new recipes: New techniques, new ingredients, new taste makes it time consuming

4. Follow recipe by: Only look at entire recipe once before starting to understand it

→ Come back when forget, do not hold phone all the time
→ Reported difficulities: sometimes make mistake that makes final dish unsatisfactory due to mis-doing a recipe step

5. Recipe criteria: Simplicity, how much time consumes, familiary and preferred taste (Indian and spicy), dish attractiveness

6. Disaster story: Not realize that didn't have enough ingredient before cooking

Success story: Replacing an ingredients in the recipe with an alternative ingredient available at home

7. Desired features:

- Calculations for custom proportions
- List some alternatives ingredients
- Recipe text is easy to follow, easy to remember
- Have pictures for each step → Know if the product at each step is how right or wrong
- Help with recipe in real time
- Inventory management

<DetailsSummary summary="Amy - 3rd year">
</DetailsSummary>

<DetailsSummary summary="Joshua - 2nd year">
1. Cook twice a week, mostly lunch and dinner

2. Go grocery once per two week. Plan recipes first then buy needed ingredients. Spend &asymp;$30 per week on grocery

3. Search for new recipe once a week when tired of eating same thing; for most days use in-memory recipes taught by family and friends.

   Find new recipes through Google and chatGPT. Prefer text-based recipe content because more precise, and scroll back easily

4. Before cooking, read the recipe carefully per step and try to remember, and then cook, and come back to check the phone for the next step

   Follow the recipe about 70%, comfortable changing the recipe if needed

5. Ranking of criteria to look for when choosing new recipe:

   1. Visual aspect (how attractive and potentially tasty a dish is)
   2. Ingredients are easy to buy and available
   3. Easy techniques, not time consuming

6. Tell a success or a disaster story you had on your cooking history?

   Disaster story: Cook too much rice for a reciple --> Final became soggy and unsatisfactory

7. Desired smart cookbook features:
   - AI that understands personal preferences and tastes
   - Recipe of the day --> Suggest novel recipes with good rating

</DetailsSummary>

### User needs analysis

Across the 4 different interviewee, there are some similaries and some differences. The following are the analysis and conclusions I drew:

- There are two main ways users shop for grocery and determine what recipes to cook next:
  1. Determine what recipes to cook first, and then buy required ingredients
  2. Buy ingredients first (usually aim for discount price) and then think about what recipes fit those ingredients
- All participants high favor simplicity and conserving time and see them as a deal breaker when choosing between recipes. After that, emphasis is placed on visual attractiveness and perceived taste of the dish.

  --> **Conclusion**: User needs a way to quickly glance the different attributes of a recipe: simplicity, time commitment, ease of obtaining ingredients, visual attractiveness, etc.

- About using recipe, some try to remember the recipe all at once but reportedly have problems mis-remembering a crucial step; some try to look at the recipe through their phone once in a while, but reported not having enough hands.

  --> **Conclusion**: Users would love to be able to remember the recipe or use the recipe hands-free when cooking.

- Desired features can be grouped into 4 main types:
  1. Suggestion of suitable new recipes; could be based on internal factors (user inventory and cooking skills) and/or external factors (other user's rating)
  2. Intuitive display of recipe that is easy to follow and remember
  3. Suggestion alternative versions of same recipes
  4. Cooking help and support: Know if the product of each step is satisfactory

### Assumption

- When used, the smart cookbook device is within 6ft distance with the user
- The smart cookbook device has an AI (or connects to an external AI) that userstands user voice commands (like Alexa or Google Home)
- The smart cookbook device come with a mobile phone application to control the device's preferences (though the device itself might still contain some buttons for basic settings)
- The user is well-versed with smartphones and technologies

### Design requirements

From analysis of user interviews and user needs, I decided the design requirements for the Smart Cookbook device:

1. User should be able to find their recipes based on their needs. These can include equipment, time or ingredient constraints.
2. User should be able to gauge the visual attrativeness of the recipe
3. User should be suggested new recipe based on their preferences
4. Once decided on a recipe, user should to be able to follow the recipe while cooking without using their limbs
5. User should be able to clearly understand the directions in the recipes.
6. User should be able to know how well they might enjoy a recipe's final taste
7. User should be able to explore alternative ingredients for a recipe that would still keep ~90% original taste

### Design challenges and 10-plus-10 sketches

I chose the following 3 design challenges and made 3 round of [10-plus-10 sketches](https://blog.elementary.io/10x10-design-process):

<DetailsSummary summary="1. How to allow user to follow and/or interract with the recipe content with minimal physical touch with the device (because user's hands might be dirty)">

## Interface implementation

### Prototype sketches

My vision for the smart cookbook product will include a smartphone application that allows user to search through the recipes
and an external screen that help users interract with the chosen recipe hands-free while cooking

Therefore, I've made a couple of sketches for the search functionalites,
how the recipes are displayed, and the external screen's recipe navigation

## Features

### C-goal feature

#### Basic UI elements

From the [design goals](#design-challenges), the smart cookbook product UI shall have the following elements:

- Control: Ability to apply different search options, ability to start a hands-free cooking session
- Display: Display the recipe content (with an image to increase the desirability), display suggested recipes, display community ratings

With these goals in minds, the basic UI is as follows:

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8">
![](/project-1-cs5167/welcome-screen.png)

<div>
The Welcome page of the mobile phone app uses **white space** used appropriately to separate different sections: the Navigation bar, the welcome message with some user info, and the suggested recipes list

**Visual hierachy** principle is also used through bold and bigger texts to indicate import heading content such as the welcome message and recipe names

The page displays the suggested recipes using **cards**, which strikes the balance between visual attractiveness
and number of recipes that can fit on screen.

Each card design contains an image at top for users to imagine the visual attractiveness of a dish, and preliminary recipe details that follow.
The ⭐ icon represents community rating; the star icon has strong symbolism with ratings, and thus using this icon helps conserve space, improve visual interest, and communicate the idea quickly.
The "Match Score" represents how much the system think this particular recipe will fit the user's personal taste.

The Search bar has the "Search recipes..." placeholder text and the Advanced Filter button has underline styles as **signifiers** for potential user actions

</div>
</div>

### B-goal feature

#### Enable the user to input a complex set of selections:

Here is the view for the advanced search:
<div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 md:gap-8">
![](/project-1-cs5167/advanced-search.png)

<div>
The Advanced Search view contains controls for different filtering options users might need, such as cook time, simplicity, protein choice.

There are different types of control such as text inputs, ranges, and checkboxes.
When interracting with ranges input, the right text will interractively update to tell what option the users have selected (i.e. &lt;1 hour, &lt;2 hour, or 3+ hour, etc.)

On submission, the JavaScript reads the form data and filters to only return recipes with the chosen keyword and options.

The "Search" button is the **primary button** so it is highlighted using a blue background. The Cancel button is secondary and thus shouldn't have any highlighting
</div>
</div>

### A-goal features

#### Connecting to a mock secondary device & Simulate the smart object in use

When a user has found a recipe they like, they can "start a cooking session" which will then send the recipe content to a secondary screen.
This secondary screen is supposedly wall-mounted and has camera that detects user gesture so they can interract (go to next step, previous step) without touching any screens

![](/project-1-cs5167/start-cooking-session-button.png)

Upon initiating a cooking session, the mobile app becomes a log of the user actions, and the secondary device displays the recipe directions step by step.
User will then navigate Next, Previous, or End Session on the 2nd screen through gesture, or in this case, simulated buttons.

Supposedly, the logs will be collected for an AI system to analyze which step the users often struggle the most
so that it will take that information into account into suggesting new and more suitable recipe skill-level wise

## Final words

I had a lot of fun doing this project. It was the first time where I actually collected user feedback and implemented an interface
solely based on users' needs and wants (and not random imagination).

Regrettably, the application was not as fleshed out as I want it to be. If I've worked more on the Smart Cookbook product, I'd implement a
Personal profile feature with preferred level of cooking skills, allergies, dietary restrictions, etc. and an alternative ingredient features
where users can explore alternative ingredients to a recipe so that they can enjoy the dish even if their inventory or budget does not have the full ingredient list
