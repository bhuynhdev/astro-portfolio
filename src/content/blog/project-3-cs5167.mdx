## Project details

The goal of this project is to demonstate conceptual interfaces for a classroom of the future where advanced technologies are available to both students and teachers, including:

1. One large, high-resolution digital wall at the front of the room 

2. Digital touch-tables

3. Personal devices brought in by students and faculty, including laptops, tablets, mobile phones, smartwatches, and AR-capable glasses

4. Sensors/microphones that capture mid-air gestures, speech, faces/facial expressions

This project focuses on designing (without implementing) a set of interfaces and interactions for this envisioned classroom, illustrated through sketches, story boards, mockups, and wireframes

## Presenting content to students (C-level goals)

### Pre-design work

#### Sampling the real world

We first sample the real world to understand what professors currently share with students, and how they share it. We use photographs and storyboard sketching to illustrate our observation of how content are taught in UC classroom, the kinds of content professors share, and how everyone interracts with the room's physical setup.
