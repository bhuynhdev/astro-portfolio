## Project details

The goal of this project is to demonstate conceptual interfaces for a classroom of the future where advanced technologies are available to both students and teachers, including:

1. One large, high-resolution digital wall at the front of the room 

2. Digital touch-tables

3. Personal devices brought in by students and faculty, including laptops, tablets, mobile phones, smartwatches, and AR-capable glasses

4. Sensors/microphones that capture mid-air gestures, speech, faces/facial expressions

This project focuses on designing (without implementing) a set of interfaces and interactions for this envisioned classroom, illustrated through sketches, story boards, mockups, and wireframes

## Presenting content to students (C-level goals)

### Pre-design work

#### Sampling the real world

We first sample the real world to understand what professors currently share with students, and how they share it. We use photographs and storyboard sketching to illustrate our observation of how content are taught in UC classroom, the kinds of content professors share, and how everyone interracts with the room's physical setup.

#### Question exploration and sample scenarios

**1. Question 1: Identify themes (and translate these themes into codes) in what you have captured**

We identified some commonality between the different images we captured:
- Regardless of subjects taught and mode of teaching (online/offline), professors usually present material sequentially (through slides) and add in live interactive materials (i.e. running code, drawing diagrams, collaborative Google Docs) to illustate the points better or for class activity --> **Code: Presentation** (image 3, 4, 6, and 9)
- During presentation of their content, professors often want solicit feedback from students, often by asking questions and looking for raised hands, or by using a technological solutions (i.e. Google Docs, quiz clickers, etc.) --> **Code: Feedback** (image 7, 8)
- Professor usually references multiple visualizations, including off-screen monitors that display other reference materials, slide notes, or the next slide, to be able to demonstrate their lecture story more cohesively --> **Code: Hidden reference** (image 6)
- Older classroom usually have big, center screens every student look to; more moderns classroom employs smaller "subscren" distributed throughout the room so that every students can see the board clearly --> **Code: Distribution** (image 2, 3, 6, and 10)

**2. Question 2: Consider how professors could share their content in this new kind of classroom**

a. What does it meant to have a larger and higher resolution display for presenting content to students?

- In large lecture halls it can be a challenge for view the presentation content for some students. Code for example, can be difficult to display in a lecture hall without enlarging the text. Professors will also have difficulty showing images on a projector when the lighting is too poor to show dark images. In DAAP for example projects do a poor job of displaying the correct color which can be a problem.
- A larger and higher resolution screen mean that professors will have more real estate and interesting way to present the hierachy of their materials, and students from any location in the room can see the materials with high details. This also means that Professor needs to be wary of fitting too many material in one screen, which could overwhelm students' processing

b. What role could personal devices or the touch-tables play in how professors present things?

-	Many professors like to write on a board or annotate their lecture notes as they go. This, however, can be a clumsy process and many professors still prefer chalk boards. Have a large touch screen that professor can write on may provide the best of both worlds, allowing professor to annotate lecture presentation or draw out problems on the board.

- Personal devices and touch tables for each students also mean students can now directly interract with the class material through the touch screen, leading to a better note-taking processes or more interactive classroom engagement activities, as now the students can work and present their work at the speed of thought

**3. Question 3: Write 3 short scenarios involving an imagined professor.  What classes do they teach?  What kinds of content do they need to present?**
-	As a professor of communication design within DAAP, Jane Doe teaches classes such as Typography, Motion Graphics, and UX/UI. While she begins these classes with a lecture, often she is reviewing student’s work and providing critique or splitting students to review each other’s work. Students will print out their work for a class such as Typography and pin it to the wall, but for a class like Motion Graphics will simply show their work on a computer screen.  
-	John Doe, a chemistry professor within A&S, often teaches classes such as Chemistry 1 or Organic Chemistry where he discusses the structure of different molecules. While he does put together a lecture presentation, Jason typically prefers to write on the chalk board. Most classes he will run out of space halfway through the class where he will then erase and what he’d drawn to free up space. Jason is also in charge of the Freshman Chemistry labs where he must oversee a number of TAs who run the day to day operations of the lab.
- Isabel Doe is a professor at the Lindner College of Business where she teaches Marketing and Entrepreneurship. In her classes students are often working on group projects and then presenting their work in front of class. She does offer a hybrid option for her classes, which means sometimes group members are not in person which can be challenging when she is lecturing or giving groups time to work.

### Design

#### Professor content sharing

**Hybrid sketches**
<div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2">

![](/project-3-cs5167/interactive_board_hybrid_sketch.png)
Professor's whiteboard is interactive with multiple digital drawing tools including colors, select tool, calculator, eraser, etc.

![](/project-3-cs5167/class_view_ar_hybrid_sketch.png)
Professor display screen is AR-capable to enable student to view extra relevant personalized information, such as hints or peers' answers.

</div>

**Figma designs**

![](/project-3-cs5167/figma-presentation-control.png)
Professor's presentation control interface including controls for room lightning, screens, speakers and microphones, and slide content. The presentation tool also suggests tips for a better lecture. This interface would be displayed on the Professor's personal device, whereas only the main screen in the middle get streamed to the big display board.

#### Professor's content creation

**Figma wireframes**
![](/project-3-cs5167/figma-prof-content-creation.png)
In this advanced and highly integrated interface for content creation, the Professor can create normal slides and then embed other cool elements into their slides to augment their lectures. Elements include normal text element, shape elements, or Canvas Quiz, Kahoot, Word Cloud, interactive holographic 3d models, etc. Elements list have a search bar. The professor would use this interface through their laptop and create the class material before lecture time. The content creation interface also includes options for animations.


#### Room control interface

**Hybrid sketches**
<div class="grid gap-6 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2">

![](/project-3-cs5167/professor_view_hybrid_sketch.png)

Class control system with AR information about real-time status of the class including attendance status, student engagement levels, and time remaining of lecture session.

</div>

**Figma designs**

![](/project-3-cs5167/figma-room-control.png)
Room control interface to be embeded onto the Professor's touch table or onto a wall. Room control features include advanced controls that manage the different inputs and ouputs devices (screens, speakers, and microphones), changing the brightness and volume level to fit with the lecture journey (for example, video viewing should require lower brightness environement) right from the Professor station. All options are spelled out clearly so that the Professor can quickly fine-tune the environment to their liking (no more fiddling random no-name buttons).
